# Crusader Kings 2 Balanced Tribal Army

This mod attempts to reduce the number of troops that spawn when using the tribal army.

For 150 prestige (down from 500) you now raise 250 troops (down from 2500) that disband when a war ends. The troops are now composed of only light infantry, archers and light cavalry.

If war focused (or martial ambition without Way of life) there is a 25% chance to raise an extra 400 troops on top of this.

The AI has been coded to attempt to raise tribal armies when nessecary. The AI will use if it has less troops than the enemy and have more than 350 prestige spare.

##Mod Compatability 
Mod will conflict with other mods that also modify the tribal army and conscript merchant ship decisions. 

Works with ck2 version 2.4.5 "Provided for fun by The Strategy Master"
